I'm a U.S. Navy veteran transitioning into a **Cybersecurity Engineer / SOC Analyst** role, with hands-on experience across detection engineering, threat hunting, incident response, and offensive security. I bring an operator mindset built in high-accountability environments and apply it to modern security operations.

## Training & Certifications

I hold the **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)** and am currently completing an **800+ hour full-time cybersecurity apprenticeship through RapidAscent**, where I build and operate security capabilities across simulated enterprise environments. My work spans Active Directory security, SIEM-based detection, network forensics, and red- and blue-team operations.

## Military Background

My background includes five years working with autonomous robotic systems in the U.S. Navy, where I led technical operations, produced concise incident and root-cause reports, and maintained mission-critical systems under time pressure. That experience translates directly into disciplined incident response, documentation, and operational reliability in security roles.

## Skills & Tools

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| SIEM & Detection | Wazuh, detection rule engineering, alert tuning, log analysis |
| Security Operations | Threat modeling, risk assessment, incident response, STRIDE |
| Infrastructure | Docker, Linux (Ubuntu), Windows Server, Active Directory |
| Scripting & Analysis | Python, network forensics, vulnerability scanning (Nessus) |
| Frameworks | NIST, GRC, SOC operational design, technical documentation |

## Featured Project

**[Atlas Industrial SOC](https://github.com/Zero-For683/atlas_industrial)** — End-to-end SOC design, architecture, and implementation for a simulated enterprise environment. Documented in the [SOC Engineering series](/categories/#blue-teaming).
