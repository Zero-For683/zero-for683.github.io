## What I do
I’m a cybersecurity analyst focused on SOC operations, threat hunting, and detection engineering, with an OSCP background and experience building security capabilities in simulated enterprise environments.

## Strengths
- Incident response: triage, scoping, and timeline building  
- Log + PCAP analysis  
- Detection engineering concepts and alert tuning  
- Windows + Linux tradecraft and telemetry mapping

## What you’ll find here
Writeups that emphasize reasoning, evidence, remediation steps, and defensive takeaways (not just step-by-step walkthroughs).
