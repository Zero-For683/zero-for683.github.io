Cybersecurity writeups, labs, and notes for learning and portfolio purposes


Each file I plan on creating a blog post with needs to have the following as an example:
```
---
title: "RDP Brute Force: Detection + Tuning (Wazuh)"
categories: [detection-engineering, incident-response]
tags: [wazuh, windows, rdp, brute-force]
---
```

Here are some main categories to sort blogs by:
- `incident-response`
- `threat-hunting`
- `detection-engineering`
- `offensive-security`
- `malware-analysis`
- `homelab`
- `tooling`
- `blue-teaming`
